# DaSEH Follow-up Survey

Thank you for taking the time to participate in this survey. We are collecting data about user experience with our course to learn more about how to improve the data science education experience. This data may ultimately be used for a research publication and reporting to the NIH.

**DATA CONFIDENTIALITY:** This survey is anonymous. The potential risks to you are small. The potential benefits to the community of data scientists, developers, and professors are very high â€“ we will be able to learn how we can improve data science/environmental health education material.

**DATA SHARING:** We plan to release the data collected from this survey only in aggregate form using GitHub (https://github.com/). No personally identifiable information is collected or will be shared.

**PARTICIPATION:** You must be 18 or over to participate. You will be asked a series of questions about your experience following the DaSEH course you previously took. You can stop participating in the survey at any point. You do not need to answer optional questions. 

Depending on how you answer the survey, this will take **~10 minutes** to complete. You will have an opportunity before submission to edit your responses. Any answers that are ultimately submitted (and not removed by the participant) will continue to be used for research.

**RISK:** Risk of participation is minimal. The questions we ask pose minimal security risk to participants as they focus on your personal experience and expectations. While we have taken measures to ensure the security of the survey responses, please be aware that no online system is completely secure. By participating in this survey, you understand and accept the inherent risks associated with transmitting information over the internet.

**CONSENT:** The first questions will ask if you are over 18 and if you consent (or agree) that the data from your responses be used for research purposes.

**QUESTIONS OR PROBLEMS:** If you have questions or problems, email Ava Hoffman at ahoffma2@fredhutch.org or contact us through the anonymous Code of Conduct Reporting Form.

You may also contact the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center IRB Office if you have questions about your rights as a participant. Contact the IRB if you feel you have not been treated fairly or if you have other concerns.

This study has been deemed exempt by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center IRB, specifically Exempt status (Category (2)(ii) Tests, surveys, interviews, or observation (low risk)). Thus, the proposed activity does not qualify as human subjects research as defined by DHHS regulations 45 CFR 46.102, and does not require IRB oversight.

IRB No.: FHIRB0020064  
Date Approved: 3/19/2024
